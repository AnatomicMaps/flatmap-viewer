# Flatmap Viewer

A web-browser viewer for anatomical flatmaps generated by [flatmap-maker](https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-maker). The viewer is intended to be used as a component in a web application, although it can be used standalone for local flatmap development and testing. Flatmap content is obtained from a [flatmap-server](https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-server).

## Package Installation

*   `pnpm install @abi-software/flatmap-viewer@4.2.6`

## Standalone Use

*   [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime environment.
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) Node package manager.

### Installation
