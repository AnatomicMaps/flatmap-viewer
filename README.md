# Flatmap Viewer

A viewer for anatomical flatmaps generated by [flatmap-maker](https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-maker). The viewer is intended to be a component of a larger Javascript web application, although may be used standalone for local flatmap development and testing. Flatmap content is obtained from a [flatmap-server](https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-server).

## Package Installation

*   `pnpm install @abi-software/flatmap-viewer@4.1.6`

## Standalone Use

### Requirements

*   [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

1)  Clone this repository.
2)  Run `pnpm install`


### Running

```
    $ pnpm dev
```

Maps can then be viewed at http://localhost:3000.


### Configuration

The map server endpoint is specified as `MAP_ENDPOINT` in `src/main.js`. It defaults to `http:localhost:4329/`, which matches the default endpoint of a local flatmap server.

## Documentation

The API is documented at `Read the Docs <https://flatmap-viewer.readthedocs.io/en/mapmaker-v2/>`.
